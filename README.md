# Player2NPC - AI Companions for Minecraft

An AI-powered companion mod for NeoForge 1.21.1 that creates intelligent NPCs you can command using natural language. Companions are powered by Ollama LLM and can perform a wide variety of tasks autonomously.

## Features

### Natural Language Commands
Talk to your companions using the `@` prefix in chat:
- `@Sam follow me` - Companion follows you
- `@Sam get me some wood` - Companion gathers resources
- `@Sam attack that zombie` - Companion fights mobs
- `@Sam go autonomous` - Companion operates independently
- `@Sam build a cottage here` - Companion builds structures

### Autonomous Behavior
Companions can operate independently when set to autonomous mode:
- **Hunt** for food (cows, pigs, sheep, chickens, fish, and modded animals)
- **Avoid** farm animals (named, leashed, or in enclosures)
- **Equip** weapons and armor from inventory
- **Patrol** the area for threats
- **Explore** your base (can open doors!)
- **Store** excess items in nearby chests or ME networks
- **Retrieve** items from AE2 ME networks

## Personality System

Each companion is randomly assigned one of **6 distinct personalities** on creation:

| Personality | Description | Example Quote |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Adventurous** | Eager and brave, loves action | "FOR GLORY!" |
| **Scholarly** | Curious and analytical, loves facts | "Statistically, diamonds appear between Y -64 and 16." |
| **Laid-back** | Casual and relaxed, loves naps | "Working hard or hardly working? ...neither, actually." |
| **Cheerful** | Optimistic and encouraging | "YAY! You're back! I missed you SO much!" |
| **Sarcastic** | Witty and playfully teasing | "Oh look, more standing around. Thrilling." |
| **Mysterious** | Cryptic and philosophical | "The void whispers... but I don't speak void." |

### Rarity-Based Behaviors
Companions have tiered dialogue that gets progressively more memorable:

| Rarity | Chance | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Common** | 70% | Everyday idle chatter and task comments |
| **Uncommon** | 20% | Environment comments + emotes |
| **Rare** | 8% | Memorable personality-specific moments |
| **Legendary** | 2% | Very special, hilarious monologues |

*Pity system*: Rare/Legendary chances increase over time if you haven't seen one recently.

### Jokes & Interactions
- **Minecraft puns**: "I lava good adventure!" / "Nether gonna give you up!"
- **Player teasing** (especially Sarcastic): "Remember when you fell in lava? Classic."
- **Other player interactions**: Companions comment on nearby players by name
- **Owner gear comments**: "Nice Diamond Sword! Ready to slay some mobs!"
- **Health warnings**: Personality-specific alerts when owner is low HP

### Emotes & Particles
- **Hearts** when happy
- **Smoke** when sad
- **Angry villager** particles when frustrated
- **Fireworks, notes, enchant glyphs** for rare/legendary moments
- **Arm swings, head turns, jumps** for physical emotes

Companions equip the best tool before mining:
- **Pickaxe** for ores, stone, cobblestone, bricks
- **Axe** for logs, wood, planks, fences
- **Shovel** for dirt, sand, gravel
- **Hoe** for leaves, hay, moss

Tool tier affects mining speed:
| Tier | Speed Multiplier |
|------|------------------|
| Wood/Gold | 2x |
| Stone | 4x |
| Iron | 6x |
| Diamond | 8x |
